# MovieList

This is a SwiftUI application that fetches and displays a list of movies with an infinite scroll feature.

It has filters by name and release year, in addition to ascending and descending sorting.

Each item in the list presents a detail screen with a button to indicate if I have already seen that title stored by imdbID.
